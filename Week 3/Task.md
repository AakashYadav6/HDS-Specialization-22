# Your moment to shine is here!!!
Create a URDF of any robot(biped, quadruped, wheeled, stationary arm, anything) of your choice. Use whatever methods/softwares you want. You're given complete freedom to do as you please. All I require is the part file, 2d drawing, and the urdf file.


## Note:- The only requirement: The robot should be designed by you, not copy-pasted and should have a reasonable level of realism (i.e. Don't join 2 cylinders to a cuboid and call it a biped, Don't build something as simple as husky etc. Push yourself and make something worthwhile to feature on the clubs page and future repos and ppts. ;) )
