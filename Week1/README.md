# Before continuing below, checkout the Installation README.

## Hope you guys were successful in installing a CAD software (Preferably SolidWorks), here is your 1st task.

## Watch These Videos:

_Note:- I know this is pretty obvious but to address the lazy share of our crowd, Keep your software open and practice simultaneously while watching the videos._

1. [Video 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PABSXVgx_cymp9JuZXqrTQQPguIVMMTh/view): **THE BASICS** - This introduces to the workspace and sketching/extrusion
2. [Video 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sCSUcTXtH7Tfc-NTKifm7dCH7cyoeRlF/view): **RENDERING** - Little long, watch at 2x speed :-) Rendering is covered in detail
3. [Video 3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19A9V_fh50sofVeteDxvZMOImBaNs0cYv/view): **Filleting/Chamfering and Shelling** - The shell tool hollows out a part, leaves open the faces you select, and creates thin-walled features on the remaining faces. It is or great use in plastic/3D printed parts. The stiffness/weight ratio is more for a shelled part

## Make these parts
