Hope you enjoyed the previous week and are excited for this week's tasks. Let's put the pedal down a bit more and throttle through the lessons of this week. We'll be pushing you people a bit more as there's a lot to learn with a lot less time but I guarantee that you won't regret anything which you learn here.

Starting with **3D Sketching** , which is an indispensable tool while designing complex parts, we'll move onto **Lofting** which would enable you to design a lot of interesting models such as those of airplanes, ships, and cars.

Lofting is a topic of special interest and used extensively. Pay special attention to it as many of us struggle with it ourselves.

Finally will come the the integral topic of **Assemblies** which will show you how to assemble your separate designed parts to form a model. We'll also be showing you how to create a 2D drawing sheet of your model which is critical in terms of application in the actual design industry.

## Good Luck!!
Start with the Week 2 [Part 1](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/HDS-Specialization-22/blob/main/Week%202/Week%202%20Part%201.md) readme and then move onto [Part 2](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/HDS-Specialization-22/blob/main/Week%202/Week%202%20Part%202.md) and finally topping it off with the [Assignment](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/HDS-Specialization-22/blob/main/Week%202/Assignment.md) readme. The [Optional](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/HDS-Specialization-22/blob/main/Week%202/Optional%20Task.md) task is upto you to attempt or not.
