# Assemblies

So up until now, you guys have been taught a lot of things which you may or may not have grasped that much clearly. Nonetheless I'm fairly certain that you clearly know how design a required part with predefined specifications.

However not all models can be made efficiently as a single part file as a real world machine is made up of numerous parts joined together with each one being designed with utmost care and focus on precision. This is where **Assemblies** come into play.

Assemblies allow you to take up multiple parts and join them together to make up your model. The advantage here being that you can focus your work on each part individually while not worrying about the other ones.

## Task: 

Go through the following videos. You'll be learning to make the assemblies with the predesigned parts provided to you.

# 2D Drawing

2D Drawings communicate information that is difficult, messy, or even impossible to express in a 3D environment.  Better yet, most 3D CAD software packages have built-in 2D drawing suites that can convert 3D models to 2D prints in only a few minutes. 
Drawings can be extremely helpful to the part designer.  They force the engineer to review their part from multiple angles and can result in the identification of design mistakes that were not noticed in the 3D environment.  Drawings can also serve as concise and compact form of design revision history for other engineers on your team.
